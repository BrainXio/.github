# BrainXio Licensing

## Overview

BrainXio is committed to open-source principles, prioritizing freedom and accessibility for all users and contributors. To achieve this, most components of the BrainXio project are released under **The Unlicense**, which dedicates our work to the public domain, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.

However, we recognize that not all situations permit The Unlicense due to dependencies, third-party contributions, or specific use cases. In such cases, we adopt alternative open-source licenses as needed, ensuring clarity and compliance.

## The Unlicense

The core BrainXio CLI (`brainxio`), initialization scripts (`initialize.sh`), and documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/`) are released under The Unlicense. This means:

- You are free to use, copy, modify, and distribute these components without restriction.
- No warranty is provided, as per the terms of The Unlicense.

The full text of The Unlicense is available at [unlicense.org](https://unlicense.org/).

## Exceptions and Flexibility

- **Dependencies**: Some BrainXio components may rely on third-party tools or libraries with their own licenses (e.g., `curl`, Bash). Users and contributors must comply with those licenses.
- **Contributions**: Contributors may propose alternative open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) for specific modules if The Unlicense is unsuitable. Such cases will be reviewed and documented clearly.
- **Future Modules**: As BrainXio grows, new modules may adopt licenses that better suit their purpose (e.g., GPL for copyleft requirements). These will be explicitly noted in the respective module’s documentation.

## How to Comply

- **Using BrainXio**: No attribution is required for Unlicensed components. For components under other licenses, follow their terms (e.g., including license notices).
- **Contributing**: When submitting code or documentation, specify your preferred license if it differs from The Unlicense. By default, contributions are assumed to be Unlicensed unless otherwise stated.
- **Distributing**: If you distribute BrainXio or its derivatives, include any required license notices for dependencies or specially licensed modules.

## Why The Unlicense?

We chose The Unlicense to embody Another-Intelligence’s values of curiosity, freedom, and accessibility. By placing our work in the public domain, we remove barriers to innovation, encouraging anyone to build, experiment, and share without legal constraints. Our flexible approach ensures we can adapt to practical needs while staying true to this ethos.
