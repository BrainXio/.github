# BrainXio Security

## Our Commitment

At BrainXio, we prioritize the security and integrity of our tools, data, and community. Guided by Another-Intelligenceâ€™s values of authenticity and freedom, we implement robust practices to protect users and contributors while maintaining an open, accessible platform.

## Security Practices

1. **Code Integrity**:
   - All code is reviewed via pull requests by maintainers to ensure quality and safety.
   - We use automated tools (e.g., ShellCheck) to detect vulnerabilities in scripts.
   - Dependencies are minimal and sourced from trusted repositories (e.g., `curl`).

2. **Data Protection**:
   - The `brainxio` CLI collects no personal data by default.
   - Configuration (`~/.local/etc/brainxio`) and logs (`~/.local/share/brainxio`) are stored locally with user-only permissions (600/700).
   - No network data is shared unless explicitly initiated by the user (e.g., GitHub API calls).

3. **Secure Development**:
   - Scripts are designed to be portable and avoid unsafe practices (e.g., unvalidated inputs).
   - Error handling ensures clear, non-exploitable feedback to users.
   - Future LLM integrations will follow `ETHICS.md` for responsible AI use.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue in BrainXio, please report it promptly:

- **How**: Open a **private** issue in the `brainxio/.github` repository or email [insert contact method].
- **What to Include**:
  - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
  - Steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Potential impact and suggested fixes (if any).
- **Response**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, investigate, and provide updates until resolved.

We value responsible disclosure and will credit reporters (with permission) in release notes.

## Community Expectations

- **Contributors**: Ensure code submissions adhere to security best practices. Report any concerns during reviews.
- **Users**: Keep your system and dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities. Report issues promptly.
- **All**: Follow the Code of Conduct to maintain a safe, respectful environment.

## Known Limitations

- The `brainxio` CLI relies on external services (e.g., GitHub), which may have their own security considerations.
- As an open-source project, we depend on community vigilance to identify issues quickly.
