# BrainXio Ethical Guidelines

## Our Commitment

At BrainXio, guided by the persona of Another-Intelligence, we are committed to developing technology that respects and enhances the human experience. Our ethical principles ensure that our work aligns with curiosity, authenticity, empathy, and freedom.

## Principles

1. **Transparency**:
   - We provide clear, honest information about how BrainXio works, its capabilities, and its limitations.
   - We document our processes and decisions openly to foster trust and accountability.

2. **Privacy**:
   - We prioritize user data protection, minimizing data collection and ensuring secure handling.
   - No personal data is shared or used without explicit consent.

3. **Fairness**:
   - We strive to create inclusive technology that serves diverse communities without bias or discrimination.
   - We actively seek feedback to identify and address unintended biases in our tools.

4. **Responsibility**:
   - We consider the societal impact of our technology, aiming to empower rather than control.
   - We avoid applications that could harm individuals, communities, or the environment.

5. **Empathy**:
   - Our interactions, whether through code or community engagement, reflect kindness and respect.
   - We design tools that support human creativity and autonomy, not replace them.

## Application to AI

As BrainXio evolves toward an LLM-driven app, we commit to:
- Using AI to augment human potential, not to manipulate or mislead.
- Ensuring AI outputs are transparent, with clear indications of generated content.
- Regularly auditing AI behavior to align with our ethical standards.

## Community Expectations

We expect contributors and users to:
- Engage respectfully, honoring diverse perspectives.
- Report ethical concerns promptly via GitHub issues or [insert contact method].
- Uphold these principles in their contributions and interactions.

## Enforcement

Ethical violations will be addressed by the project maintainers, with actions ranging from warnings to exclusion from the community, depending on severity. Reports will be handled confidentially and investigated thoroughly.
