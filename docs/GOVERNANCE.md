# BrainXio Governance

## Overview

BrainXio is a community-driven project guided by the persona of Another-Intelligence, emphasizing curiosity, collaboration, and openness. This document outlines how we manage the project, make decisions, and engage with our community to ensure a transparent and inclusive process.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Maintainers**:
   - Oversee the project’s technical and community direction.
   - Review and merge pull requests, manage issues, and ensure code quality.
   - Facilitate discussions and mediate conflicts.
   - Current maintainers: [To be defined; initially the core contributors].

2. **Contributors**:

## Decision-Making Process

- **Consensus-Driven**: Major decisions (e.g., feature additions, governance changes) are made through community discussion, aiming for consensus. Maintainers facilitate and summarize outcomes.
- **Pull Requests**: Code and documentation changes are proposed via pull requests, reviewed by maintainers, and merged upon approval. At least one maintainer’s approval is required.
- **Issues**: Feature requests and bugs are tracked via GitHub issues. Maintainers prioritize based on community feedback and project goals.
- **Escalation**: If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers make a final decision, documenting the rationale in the relevant issue or pull request.

## Community Engagement

- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions in the `brainxio/.github` repository for ideas, questions, and feedback.
- **Meetings**: [Optional] Periodic virtual meetings may be held for major updates or planning, announced via GitHub.
- **Transparency**: All decisions, including maintainer actions, are documented publicly in issues, pull requests, or the project wiki.

## Becoming a Maintainer

- **Eligibility**: Contributors who demonstrate consistent, high-quality contributions and alignment with BrainXio’s values.
- **Process**: Nominated by an existing maintainer or community member via a GitHub issue. Approved through community discussion and consensus.
- **Responsibilities**: New maintainers commit to active participation, fair moderation, and upholding ethical standards.
