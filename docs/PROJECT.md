# BrainXio Project Overview

## Purpose
The BrainXio is a Python-based command-line tool designed to provide a modular, open-source platform for automation and AI-driven tasks. It aims to be simple, scalable, and reliable, with JSON logging to $HOME/.brainxio/log.json for auditability.

## Goals
- **Simplicity**: Deliver a minimal, user-friendly CLI.
- **Modularity**: Enable extensibility for future features.
- **Reliability**: Ensure robust error handling and 100% test coverage.
- **Open-Source**: Follow PEP 8 and encourage community contributions.

## Project Structure
- `src/brainxio/core/main.py`: Core implementation.
- `tests/core/test_main.py`: Pytest suite.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, typeguard).

## Technical Standards
- **Language**: Python 3.12.
- **Testing**: Pytest, aiming for 100% coverage.
- **Logging**: JSON-formatted logs to $HOME/.brainxio/log.json.
- **Style**: PEP 8, with clear docstrings.
- **Coverage**: Use `# pragma: no cover` only for entry point.

## Development Approach
- **Iterative**: Build in small, fully tested steps:
  - Step 1: Logging setup with 100% coverage.
  - Step 2: Add CLI functionality.
- **Testing**: Test all branches, including error cases.
- **Validation**: Run `pytest --cov=src/brainxio` to verify 100% coverage.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Submit changes via pull requests.
- Ensure all tests pass and coverage is 100%.
- Follow PEP 8 and include docstrings.

## Next Steps
- Complete Step 1 with logging setup.
- Iterate to add CLI features.

This project is the foundation for a scalable, community-driven CLI.
